# Port-Scanner

This Python-based Port Scanner is a simple yet effective tool that allows users to scan a target host for open network ports. With this code, you can quickly identify which ports on a remote server are actively listening for incoming connections. It supports scanning multiple common ports and provides a list of open ports for further network analysis.

This is for learning purposes and I agree that there could be better port scanners.
